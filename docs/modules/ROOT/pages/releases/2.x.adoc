= 2.x.x release notes

[#2-0-0]
== 2.0.0.RELEASE

Across 5.0.0 is now required.

=== Extension module
ApplicationInfoModule configuration has been modified to extend the new AcrossContextInfrastructureModule configuration.
It no longer starts its own `ApplicationContext`.

Most applications should have no effect from this, but bean autowiring qualified with `@Module(ApplicationInfoModule.NAME)` will fail.
